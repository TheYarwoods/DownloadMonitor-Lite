# DownloadMonitor-Lite (GPLv3)
### Free, open source, minimalist network usage monitor. For the full-featured version, see [DownloadMonitor (commercial)](https://downloadmonitor.net)


This is a free, open source version of DownloadMonitor, based on an early development version

The original goal of DownloadMonitor was to create a lightweight, simple, and customisable application to quickly view your network usage. 

While I believe the commercial release excels at this brief, I also recognise that many people simply want a barebones application with no frills or extra features

I also believe releasing such an application will help gain trust, as well as encourage other developers to take this shell and expand it into their own projects

This code is made available under the GPLv3 license. More information can be found in copyright.txt and license.txt

### What does it do?

The app shows your current network usage in a minimalist widget that can be dragged around the desktop
It supports basic customisation in the form of adjusting primary and secondary colours
